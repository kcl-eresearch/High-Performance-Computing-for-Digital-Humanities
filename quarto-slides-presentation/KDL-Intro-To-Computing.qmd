# Introduction to High-Performance Computing

---

# Part 1: Computing Foundations

## Slide 1: Meet Your Instructors
- **Max Wyatt** - e-Research Operations Engineer
- **Liz Ing-Simmons** - e-Research Senior Research Software Engineer  
- **James Graham** - Head of Software Engineering

## Slide 2: Today's Journey
**From your laptop to supercomputers**

By the end of this workshop, you'll understand:
- What makes a computer tick
- When and why to use HPC
- How to work with HPC systems

## Slide 3: A Brief History of Computing

**From human calculators to digital machines**

- **Before computers**: Slide rules, mechanical calculators, human "computers"
- **Katherine Johnson**: Calculated space flight trajectories by hand
- **1940s-1950s**: First electronic computers (room-sized!)
- **Today**: Computers everywhere, powering all modern research

## Slide 4: What is a Computer?

**A programmable machine that follows instructions**

Modern computers excel at:
- Fast, accurate calculations
- Processing large amounts of data  
- Running complex simulations
- Automating repetitive tasks

## Slide 5: Computer Limitations

**What computers still can't do:**
- Know what you *actually* wanted
- Work without clear instructions
- Understand context like humans do

*Even AI has these limitations - it needs training data and still makes assumptions*

# Part 2: Computer Components

## Slide 6: Core Computer Components

**The essential parts every computer needs:**

- **CPU (Central Processing Unit)**: The "brain" - executes instructions
- **Memory (RAM)**: Short-term storage for active work (*volatile*)
- **Storage**: Long-term storage for files and programs (*persistent*)  
- **Motherboard**: Connects everything together

## Slide 7: Specialized Components

**Additional parts for specific tasks:**

- **GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)**: Parallel processing powerhouse
- **Network Interface**: Connects to other computers
- **Operating System**: Manages all the hardware and software

**Activity**: Share your laptop specs with a neighbor - what OS, CPU, and RAM do you have?

## Slide 8: CPU vs GPU - When to Use Each

**CPU: Complex tasks, few at a time**
- General-purpose computing
- Complex decision-making
- Sequential processing

**GPU: Simple tasks, many at once**  
- Graphics rendering
- Machine learning training
- Parallel data processing

**Activity**: Look up whether your research workflows could benefit from GPU acceleration

# Part 3: From Single Computers to HPC

## Slide 9: What is High-Performance Computing?

**When one computer isn't enough...**

HPC = Many computers working together as one powerful system

- Handles problems too big for single computers
- Used in science, engineering, and research
- Connected by high-speed networks

## Slide 10: HPC System Architecture

**Four types of nodes (computers) in an HPC cluster:**

- **Login nodes**: Where you connect and prepare work
- **Compute nodes**: Where the actual calculations happen  
- **Storage nodes**: Where data is stored
- **Management nodes**: Keep everything running

**Activity**: Find examples of UK HPC systems (hint: King's has CREATE!)

## Slide 11: Why Parallel Computing?

**The power of working together**

- **Problem**: Some tasks are too big or slow for one computer
- **Solution**: Split work into smaller pieces
- **Benefit**: Multiple processors work simultaneously
- **Result**: Faster completion, bigger problems solved

## Slide 12: What Benefits from Parallel Computing?

**Perfect for parallel processing:**
- Large dataset analysis
- Scientific simulations  
- Machine learning training
- Image/video processing

**Activity**: Discuss with your table - what workflows might you run in parallel?

# Part 4: Working with HPC Systems

## Slide 13: The Job Scheduler - Your HPC Manager

**Think of it like a restaurant queue manager**

- **You**: Submit a "job" (your computational task)
- **Scheduler**: Manages the queue and assigns resources
- **System**: Runs your job when resources are available

![Restaurant Queue Manager](images/resturant_queue_manager.svg)

*We'll use Slurm scheduler in this workshop*

## Slide 14: Jobs and Job Scripts

**A job** = A unit of work for the HPC system

**A job script** = Instructions telling the system:
- What program to run
- How much memory/CPU needed  
- How long it will take
- Where to save results

*Think of it as a recipe for your computation*

## Slide 15: Software Management

**Three ways to manage software on HPC:**

**Modules**: Load/unload software packages
- `module spider python` - search for software

**Containers**: Portable, complete environments  
- Everything packaged together

**Virtual Environments**: Isolated Python setups
- Keep project dependencies separate

**Activity**: Try `module spider` with a software package you use

## Slide 16: HPC Best Practices & Etiquette

**Be a good HPC citizen:**

- **Plan ahead**: Estimate resources needed (CPU, memory, time)
- **Test small**: Use small datasets first
- **Monitor jobs**: Check progress with `squeue`, `sacct`
- **Clean up**: Remove unnecessary files
- **Share fairly**: Don't monopolize resources
- **Ask for help**: Contact support when stuck

# Part 5: Wrap-up

## Slide 17: Key Terms to Remember

**Essential HPC vocabulary:**

- **Node**: Individual computer in the cluster
- **Core**: Processing unit within a CPU  
- **Job**: Your computational task
- **Queue**: Waiting line for jobs
- **Scheduler**: Resource manager (like Slurm)
- **Cluster**: Group of connected computers

## Slide 18: What's Next?

**Your HPC journey continues with:**
- Hands-on CREATE system access
- Writing your first job scripts
- Running real computational tasks
- Exploring software modules

**Resources:**
- CREATE documentation
- Institutional HPC support
- Community forums and guides
